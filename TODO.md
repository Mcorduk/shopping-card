# TODO

- Build individual card elements for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.

- Since Items are an array of objects
  update the add item function to:

# FIXME

-

# QOL
